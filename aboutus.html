            Hello users, <br><br>
            We are the developers of CoHosp and we introduce you to the community of CoHosp. Starting from scratch we came a long way now. Getting support of you all, we are here connecting doctors and patients from our platform. <br><br>
            In planning to make all in one website we have attached <a href="resources.html">resources</a> page on which you can get various other facilities. <br><br>
            Doctors from all over India are joining us for the information of beds availability which we tranmit to our users. Simple  <a href="login.html">login</a> procedure for doctors and simple register option for patients make the work more easy for them.<br><br>
            <a href="contactus.html">We two</a> are students at IIT Palakkad and planning further to help you with more such networks.<br><br> 
            Till then stay home, stay safe.
